## Media Player 

The media player is functional but still in development. The assets folder contains songs for testing purposes. 

Current bugs:
- Time on the slider gets corrupted after sliding through the song. 
- Need to add functionality to show repeat and shuffle are on/off. 
- Need to add functionality to repeat one/all songs. 
- Need to add functionality that supports drag & drop of music to player.
