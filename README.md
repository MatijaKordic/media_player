### Media Player 

The media player is functional but still in development. 

Current bugs:
- Time on the slider gets corrupted after sliding through the song. 
- Shuffle not fully operational
- Styles not fully operational

## Installing env

You will need to preinstall anaconda. Docker is comming up soon. 

'''conda env create -f environment.yml'''

## Running the player

'''python main.py'''
